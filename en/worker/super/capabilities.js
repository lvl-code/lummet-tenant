// =====================================================
// SUPER API — CAPABILITY MANIFEST
// Static per-deployment description of which Super API
// resources this codebase version supports. Lummet reads
// this at handshake time to show/hide dashboard features
// per rule #16/#17 (capability + version discovery).
// =====================================================

// Version 2: added components, page_components ("blocks"),
// permissions matrix, nav_items, banners, and base64-JSON media
// upload. Existing v1 resources are unchanged — a Lummet control
// plane that only knows v1 can keep working against everything it
// already used; it just won't show the new resources until it
// checks capabilities/version again.
// Version 6: added SEO landing pages (country_custom /
// category_country) — seo_pages + seo_page_casinos.
// Version 7: added Affiliate Partner & Program Management (System 1),
// Offer & Bonus Management (System 2), and Tracking Link Management
// with GEO-aware redirect resolution and link health monitoring
// (System 3). commercial_terms is read+create only through this
// Super API (terms are versioned/immutable, no plain edit --
// superseding is a deliberate two-step action).
// Version 8: added Analytics -- analytics_overview (tenant-wide
// performance-by-dimension summary), analytics_revenue (tenant-wide
// daily revenue/commission time series, single-currency only, never
// silently summed across currencies), and tracking_health (current
// status counts + which links are currently unhealthy). All three are
// pre-aggregated summaries only -- raw analytics_events, individual
// visitor data, and the full tracking_link_health_checks history are
// deliberately NOT exposed through this API. report_definitions/
// report_runs, campaigns, and alerts are NOT exposed yet -- deferred
// pending confirmation the control plane needs report/alert data (not
// just analytics numbers) through this channel.
// Version 9: added Reports (list/get/create + trigger an ad-hoc run
// returning its output), Campaigns (full CRUD), and Alerts (list/create
// rules, list/acknowledge alerts) -- confirmed need from the control
// plane for all three. Report output returned via /reports/:id/run is
// aggregated KPI data, the same trust tier as the v8 analytics
// endpoints. Historical report_runs rows carry no stored row output
// (only status/row_count/error) -- nothing to leak by listing past
// runs. Alert-rule create/delete parity with the tenant dashboard's
// own admin-only gating; Super API's credential is already tenant-
// wide-admin-equivalent by design (see handlers-analytics.js).
//
// Version 9.1 (no version bump, manifest-only fix): payment_methods,
// inquiries, submissions, notifications, newsletter, seo,
// postback_configs, provider_adapter_configs, and import_batches were
// all already live routes in router.js (some since v1) but never
// listed here -- this manifest had simply drifted from the route
// table, it wasn't a deliberate omission. Backfilled below so
// /handshake and /capabilities report what this deployment actually
// supports.
//
// Version 10: added Editorial AI Tools (generate-review, generate-seo,
// generate-faqs, generate-schema, generate-outline, improve-content,
// suggest-links) -- generation-only wrappers around
// en/worker/ai/admin-tools.js, see handlers-ai.js header for scope.
// Requires env.AI configured on the tenant Worker; `available` from
// GET .../ai/availability (or `generated: false` from any generation
// route) tells the caller when it isn't, rather than a 500.
